## 👋 Hello, World!

I'm **Junian** the **Experienced Software Engineer** from [East Java](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/East_Java).

📝 My coding adventures primarily happen in C and Java-based languages, but I like to mix it up with C++, C#, JavaScript, TypeScript, Dart, and more. I also like Python.

🌍 I can speak 3 languages: English, Indonesian, and [Javanese](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javanese_language). Bonus: I can also scribble in the [Javanese Script](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Javanese_script).

☕️ As you can guess, my favorite cup of coffee is Java Arabica, no cream and sugar—just the way I like it.

🌞 Fun fact: Every morning, I take out the trash from my house, making me a real-life Java Garbage Collector.

❤️ While I enjoy playing the field with many programming languages, **C#** has a special place in my heart.
